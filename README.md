Design Patterns Practice
Real world examples

Abstrac Factory
	Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Abstract Method
 	Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses

Singleon
	Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

Facate
	Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
